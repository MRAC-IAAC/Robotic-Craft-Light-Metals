# Folded Staircase

## Miura Fold

Where the idea of the geometry came from:

The changes in swirl, ‘v’ and ‘u’ values affected the proportions of the units, difficulty of the assembly

of the pieces, strength of the general geometry.

## Robotic Bending

The bending of the plates is the part of fabrication that is being done by the use of the robots. This is because the bends require a high accuracy on the angle what can be provided by the robot. Also the speed of folding is a lot faster than bending it by hand. The robot bends 301 pieces with a maximum duty cycle of 27 second a plate and a total fabrication of 121 minutes.

## hardware

The hardware consists of three main parts which each have a role in the robotic setup:

1: The rack: A rack with two pins to hold the material on the right place for the pick up.

2: Robotic gripper: The tool on the robot that grips the plate from the rack and bends it together with the static gripper. It is made from plywood in CNC with a handmade steel plate to strengthen it while folding.

3: Static gripper: This grips the other side of the material while bending it. It is made from the same materials as the robotic gripper

## Assembly

To assemble all the pieces with the bracket pieces the rivet gun is used. This tool makes it possible to connect the pieces from the outside with a clean finish.

## Outlook

This fabrication method stands out for its speed and ease of assembly. The flat sheets structural capacity increases with the folds and forms a light weight structure. This method can be used to build geometries with self-support solidarity and make it light- weight.

Creating a structure with:

* Being able to create structure giving many folds in a complex relation
* Using very less material
* Fully automated robot bending of the pieces.
* Being able to assemble this from outside
