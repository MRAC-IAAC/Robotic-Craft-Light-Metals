# Robotic-Craft-Light-Metals
In this project we research the automatization of manufacturing metal profiles. More specifically the bending of structural profiles to precisely achieve a desired curve. In this project we explore the bending of aluminum profiles which are ideally shaped for lightweight reinforced structures in automotive and aerospace industries.

The properties of this thin material allow for easier manufacturing, manipulation and transportation processes.

##Metal shaping methods

Almost any metal manufacturing process can be either manually, motorized or automatically operated.


Manual		>		Motorized		>		Automatic

In our case we wanted to develop an automatic process on aluminum angle bending, that implied a motorized process with a predictable result on the manufacturing from the design phase.

On the following table, there is a comparison among the operational dimensions (in 1, 2 or 3 directions) of manufacturing 3 different shapes of metals.

The dotted cases are still to be fully industrially developed to get the desired automatic process. Therefore, we are focused on the dynamic or non-regular deformation in 2 directions on metal angles and profiles.

More exactly, we chose the “L” shaped angles, with identical wall lengths to ensure the biggest structural strength with the minimum amount of material with symmetrical results, also giving us the chance to test the deformation on both sides.
