# Robotic-Craft-Light-Metals
In this project we research the automatization of manufacturing metal profiles. More specifically the bending of structural profiles to precisely achieve a desired curve. In this project we explore the bending of aluminum profiles which are ideally shaped for lightweight reinforced structures in automotive and aerospace industries.

The properties of this thin material allow for easier manufacturing, manipulation and transportation processes.
